# V0.2 — "Useful"

## Purpose

buddy can *do things*. Introduce the skill system with 2–3 built-in skills.

## Capabilities

- A `Skill` trait: name, description, input schema (JSON Schema), output schema, `async fn execute(input) -> Result<Output, SkillError>`
- Skill registry: skills declare themselves at startup, backend exposes their schemas to the LLM as tool definitions
- Built-in skills:
  - **`read_file`** — read a file from an explicitly configured sandbox directory
  - **`write_file`** — write to the same sandbox directory
  - **`fetch_url`** — HTTP GET with allowlisted domains (configurable)
- Tool-call loop: LLM requests a skill → backend executes it → result fed back → LLM continues
- Conversation persistence to SQLite (messages + tool calls + results, all stored)
- Conversation list in the UI; ability to start new conversations
- Second provider implementation (e.g., Anthropic or Ollama) to validate the `Provider` trait actually works for >1 backend

## Key Architectural Decisions

- Skills run in a `Sandbox` context that is explicitly configured per-skill. `read_file` gets a list of allowed directories. `fetch_url` gets an allowlist. No skill has implicit access to anything.
- The skill registry is static (compiled in). No dynamic loading yet. This keeps the security surface tiny.
- Tool calls are rendered visibly in the UI — the user sees what buddy did, not just the final answer. Transparency is a feature.
- SQLite for persistence. No ORM. Raw queries with `rusqlite`. The schema is simple enough that an ORM adds complexity without value.

## Intentionally Not Included

- No user-defined skills or skill-creator framework
- No memory beyond conversation history
- No multi-agent or delegation
- No Telegram/WhatsApp
- No approval flow for dangerous actions (sandbox config is the entire security model)

## Sets Up V0.3 By

The skill trait and registry are the foundation for the skill-creator framework. SQLite persistence is the foundation for long-term memory. The tool-call UI patterns will extend to showing agent delegation.
